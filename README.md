## Overview

This project showcases an interactive Pricing Component is a dynamic and user-friendly 
feature designed to allow users to explore subscription plans effectively.

## The challenge

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**:
   Used for structuring the page with semantic tags like header, main, form, etc.
- **CSS3**
   Applied for styling, with features such as Flexbox and grid for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**
    Used to dynamically display the prices for the selected plans, implement a toggle button to switch between
    monthly and yearly options, and calculate the total price with a discount applied to yearly plans before submission.

## Features:

Semantic HTML: Utilized semantic HTML5 elements to structure the page meaningfully and improve accessibility.
SCSS Styling: Applied  SCSS for styling, focusing on a clean and modern design with mobile responsiveness.
JavaScript: Added JavaScript for display the prices for the selected plans, implement a toggle button to switch between
monthly and yearly options, and calculate the total price with a discount applied to yearly plans before submission.
